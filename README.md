<p>Cloud computing provide are significant because they ensure that there is constant service delivery within an organization and also from one organization to another. Moreover, there are different cloud computing service providers and they perform different functions.Cloud computing providers are able to control and revitalize different technological sectors through proliferation of services.<br /><br /><strong>Cloud computing providers use the following features:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Infrastructure as a service</strong><br /><br />Most cloud computing providers use infrastructure as a service to offer virtual space to different organizations. The virtual space offered helps customers host and also develop other services. The benefit of using infrastructure as a service is that organizations are able to link up all its services. Cloud computing providers also use infrastructure as a service to boast predictive analysis, for private storage and in the recovery of service disasters. Through this service, cloud computing providers have managed to support all its customers.<br /><br />Cloud computing providers so offer storage facilities that can handle either structured or unstructured data for instance documents to documents, documents to pictures and other multiple sources. Cloud computing providers are able to successfully use infrastructure as a service because they have automated systems that files and checks actions fed on the systems.<br /><br /><em><strong>Software as a service</strong></em><br /><br />Software as a service is where the software is usually hosted in the available clouds and then appears on different devices. Devices with this service always function normally. Cloud computing providers use software a service because it helps customers track all dealings they make with potential customers. In addition, it is very easy to access this service.<br /><br />Cloud computing providers encourage firms to use this service because it aids in integration and development of new apps.<br /><br /><em><strong>Platform as a service</strong></em><br /><br />Platform as a service is also significant because it is used by cloud computing provides to build other applications for mobile and website platforms using advanced tools. There are different categories and variations of platform as a service which entirely depends on the cloud computing providers. <br /><br />Variations in platform as a service<br /><br />•    Cloud based service in online <br /><br />•    Cloud based service in enterprise<br /><br />•    cloud based service in platform<br /><br />Platform as a service also supports different programming languages in multiple databases and offers third party programs sing virtualized tools that run processes in different environment.<br /><br /><em><strong>Desktop as a service</strong></em><br /><br />Cloud computing services use desktop as a service in the virtualization of desktop programs. It also provides hosted applications that aid in linking different functions of an organization.Cloud computing providersuses this service to provide remote desktops with different capabilities and allow users to run different operating systems for instance Windows Vista, Windows 7, XP within a virtual environment that is hosted by another server.<br /><br />In addition, this service helps different cloud computing providers’ process power, monitor software and run multiple operating systems by connecting to local servers and other users.<br /><br />Cloud computing providers are important because they offer different web interfaces that can connect to different users therefore users are able to run either one or several operating systems on computers.</p>
